# discrete-counting-problem-check
Short python program designed to check a discrete math counting problem and translate said problem into code

The problem is as follows.

A 5-digit number is formed according to the rules:

Rule 1: The number contains only the digits 1,2,3,4 and these digits may be repeated or unused.

Rule 2: The first digit is 1

Rule 3: If D1D2 are consecutive digits and D1 does not equal D2 then D1 < D2

Rule 4: If D1D2 are consecutive digits and D1=4 then D2=1

How many of the 5 digit numbers of this type are there?
